# Car Rental Price Analysis Project

The Car Rental Price Analysis project aims to explore pricing information from three distinct car rental websitesâ€”Avis, CarRentals.com, and Enterprise. The objective is to evaluate cars based on factors such as pickup and drop-off locations, dates, car type, price, and distance, with the goal of identifying the most budget-friendly options on these platforms.

## Objective
